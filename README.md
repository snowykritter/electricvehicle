# Electric Vehicle

Science Olympiad

Components:
* Arduino Uno R3
* 8 AA Battery Holder
* BLDC Motor 2200 kV
* Potentiometer
* 30A Motor ESC
* Breadboard
* Buttons

How it works:
1. Clicking on the "set" button records the value of the potentiometer
2. The value of the potentiometer is mapped to a range, which calculates how many revolutions the motor should spin.
3. Clicking the "start" button runs the motor
